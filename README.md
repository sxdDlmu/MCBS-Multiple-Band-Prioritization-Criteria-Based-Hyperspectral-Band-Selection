This is a matlab code for multi-criteria band selection (MCBS) algorithm.  

MCBS combines three commonly used criteria (information entropy, maximum variance principal component analysis and 
noise estimation) to provide a more comprehensive band evaluation. It proved to be more stable and was suggested to 
participate in the comparative analysis as a representative of some traditional methods.
